Moodle 2.7+ Question Behaviour with Multiple Tries and Hint Button.
by Carl LeBlond

Usage:
Similar to Interactive with Multiple tires, except it shows the hintshidden while attempting.
Students are not penalized for looking at hint, but are penalized for
each additional try.  Maybe next version will do this.
Simply add your hints and penalties to the multiple tries section while 
you are editing the question.  Choose Interactive with Hint Button as your 
question behaviour while previewing question or setting up your quizzes.
